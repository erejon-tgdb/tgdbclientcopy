If you have another valid, signed agreement with Licensor or a Licensor authorized reseller which 
applies to the specific products or services you are downloading, accessing, or otherwise receiving, 
that other agreement controls; otherwise, by using, downloading, installing, copying, or accessing 
Software, Maintenance, or Consulting Services, or by clicking on "I accept" on or adjacent to the

        Form or purchase order.
    c.  Unless otherwise permitted under this Agreement and the Documentation, Customer 
        shall not: 
        i.  make more copies of the Software than the specified Number of Units stated in an 
            Order Form (except for a reasonable number of copies for archival purposes) or 
            use any unlicensed versions of the Software;
        ii. use any Software that is not listed in an Order Form even if such unlicensed 
            software is made available to Customer as part of Licensor's general delivery 
            mechanisms;
        iii. provide access to the Software to anyone other than Authorized Users;
        iv. sublicense, distribute or pledge the Software or any of the rights herein;
        v.  lease, rent or commercially share (including time-share) or use the Software for 
            purposes of providing processing services, including, providing third-party hosting, 
            application integration, application service provider-type services, or service 
            bureau;
        vi. use or access any embedded or bundled component of Software on a stand-alone

        vii. use Third Party Software except in conjunction with the Licensor Software and 
            subject to the same use rights that it has to the Licensor Software.
        viii. use any third party software, including any open source software, in conjunction 
            with any Software, unless Customer ensures that such use does not cause the 
            Software to become subject to any third party license applicable to such third party 
            software or require the public disclosure or distribution of any Software or the 
            licensing of any Software for Materials or the purpose of making derivative works; 
            and
        ix. modify, translate, reverse engineer, decrypt, decompile, disassemble, create 
            derivative works based on, or otherwise attempt to discover the Software source 
            code or underlying ideas, techniques or algorithms, provided, however, that 
            Customer may engage in such conduct as is necessary to ensure the 
            interoperability of the Software as required by law. Prior to commencing any de-
            compilation or reverse engineering, Customer will observe strict obligations of 
            confidentiality and provide Licensor with reasonable advance written notice and the 
            opportunity to assist with or conduct such activity on Customer's behalf and at 
            Customer's expense.
    d.  Licensor shall deliver the Software electronically and delivery is deemed complete when 
        such Software is made available to Customer.
    e.  ISV Customer and SaaS Customer specific terms are stated at: 
        https://terms.tibco.com/posts/1143002.

        https://terms.tibco.com/posts/1452906-supplemental-terms-tibco-foresight
        apply.

3.  Financial Terms. 
    a.  Customer shall pay Licensor any fees or payments net 30 days from Licensor's invoice. 
        Licensor may charge Customer an additional 1.5% per month (or such lower amount as 
        required by applicable law) for all fees that are not paid on time.
    b.  Licensor may increase annual recurring fees at any time upon 60 days prior written 
        notice.
    c.  Customer shall pay all sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption, 
        withholding, excise and any other similar taxes or government charges, exclusive of 
        Licensor's income taxes.
    d.  Except as expressly stated in the "Term and Termination" or "Warranties" section, all 
        fees paid by Customer are non-refundable and no right of set off exists.
    e.  Licensor does not permit aggregation of products, services, purchase or license models 
        or cumulative fees paid across separate Product Lines to trigger preferred pricing or 
        discounts.

4.  Ownership. Licensor and its licensors own all Software, Materials, and Documentation and all 
    derivatives thereof (collectively "Protected Materials"), which are protected by applicable U.S. 
    and international patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Customer must duplicate 
    unaltered copies of all proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Protected Materials. 
    Except as stated in the Agreement, Customer receives no other rights to use any of Licensor's 
    Marks.

5.  Confidentiality. 
    a.  Neither party shall disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the 
        disclosing party's prior consent. Confidential Information may only be disclosed to 
        individuals that need to know such information, and on the condition that the individual is 
        subject to a written agreement to protect information with terms as protective as this 
        Agreement. For the purposes of this section, the definition of Licensor and Customer 
        includes Affiliates of either party. Licensor may use data collected during the Term in an 
        aggregated, anonymized form, provided that such data is aggregated from more than 
        one customer and does not identify Customer, Customer employees, or Customers' 
        customers. 
        i.  The duty to protect Confidential Information does not apply to information that is 
            shown to be:
        ii. available to the public other than by a breach of a confidentiality obligation;
        iii. rightfully received from a third party not in breach of a confidentiality obligation;
        iv. independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential Information of 
            the other;
        v.  known to the recipient at the time of disclosure (other than under a separate 
            confidentiality obligation);
        vi. produced in compliance with applicable law or court order, provided the other party 
            is given reasonable advance notice of the obligation to produce Confidential 
            Information (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the 
            disclosing party's cost, if the disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure.
    b.  Except as expressly stated in the "Term and Termination" or "Warranties" section, all 
        fees paid by Customer are non-refundable and no right of set off exists.
    c.  Each party shall indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) 
        the other may sustain resulting from a breach of this Section. Money damages may not 
        be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. If either party breaches the 
        confidentiality obligations, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other equitable 
        relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such 
        injunctive or equitable relief is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law 
        or in equity.
    d.  Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party; except for 
        rights explicitly granted in the Agreement, the receiving party does not acquire any rights 
        to such Confidential Information.

6.  Data Protection and Back-up. 
    a.  If Customer exposes Licensor to an individual's Protected Data, Licensor will process 
        and store such information pursuant to Licensor's Security Policies, Practices and 
        Processes found at https://terms.tibco.com/posts/2301934-tibco-security-guidelines. If 
        the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679) (GDPR) 
        applies to Protected Data that Licensor processes on behalf of Customer as a data 
        processor, then the Licensor's Data Processing terms at 
        https://terms.tibco.com/posts/3309971-tibco-data-processing-agreement apply to such 
        Protected Data.
    b.  Except when Licensor stores Customer data in connection with the delivery of a Cloud 
        Service, Customer is responsible for backing-up its data and under no circumstances is 
        Licensor responsible for the protection, loss, destruction, or maintenance of Customer's 
        data.

7.  Indemnity. 
    a.  Licensor shall, at its own expense, defend or at its option, settle, any claim or action 
        brought against Customer to the extent it is based on a claim that the Software, or 
        Materials, all as updated by Licensor and used in accordance with the Agreement, 
        infringes any patent, copyright, or any trade secret of a third party. Furthermore, Licensor 
        will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against damages, costs, and fees 
        reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are attributable 
        exclusively to such claim or action and which are assessed against Customer in a final 
        judgment. Licensor's obligations to defend, settle, or indemnify Customer are subject to 
        (i) Customer promptly notifying Licensor in writing of such claim; (ii) Licensor having the 
        exclusive right to control such defense and/or settlement; and (iii) Customer providing 
        reasonable assistance (at Licensor's expense) in the defense thereof. Customer shall not 
        settle any claim, action or proceeding without Licensor's prior written approval.
    b.  LICENSOR SHALL NOT DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, OR HOLD CUSTOMER HARMLESS 
        FOR ANY CLAIM IF: (A) CUSTOMER MADE MODIFICATIONS TO THE SOFTWARE 
        OR MATERIALS OR PORTIONS THEREOF; (B) SUCH CLAIM WOULD HAVE BEEN 
        AVOIDED BY USE OF THE THEN CURRENT RELEASE OF THE SOFTWARE MADE 
        AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER; (C) CUSTOMER CONTINUED ITS ALLEGEDLY 
        INFRINGING ACTIVITY AFTER BEING PROVIDED WITH MODIFICATIONS THAT 
        WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT; OR (D) SUCH CLAIM IS 
        BASED ON CUSTOMER'S OUTPUT.
    c.  IF LICENSOR DEFENDS OR SETTLES AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ARISING UNDER 
        SECTION 7.A ABOVE, LICENSOR'S LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND 
        EXCLUSIVE REMEDY (IN ADDITION TO THE "INDEMNITY") SHALL BE FOR 
        LICENSOR AT ITS OWN EXPENSE, TO EITHER (A) REPAIR, REPLACE OR MODIFY 
        THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE OR RE-PERFORM THE AFFECTED CONSULTING 
        SERVICES OR (B) ALTERNATIVELY, PROCURE FOR CUSTOMER THE RIGHT TO 
        CONTINUE TO USE THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE OR MATERIALS. IF THE 
        FOREGOING REMEDIES ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE (IN THE 
        REASONABLE OPINION OF LICENSOR), LICENSOR MAY (I) CANCEL THE 
        APPLICABLE ORDER FORM AND, AS APPLICABLE, FOR THE AFFECTED 
        SOFTWARE REFUND THE LICENSE FEES AND ANY UNEARNED MAINTENANCE 
        FEES PAID TO LICENSOR BY CUSTOMER FOR THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE, OR 
        (II) FOR CONSULTING SERVICES REFUND ALL AMOUNTS PAID TO LICENSOR BY 
        CUSTOMER FOR THE AFFECTED CONSULTING SERVICES.

8.  Warranties. 
    a.  Licensor warrants that for 90 days following the Delivery Date ("Warranty Period"), the 
        Software, as updated and used in accordance with the Documentation, will operate in all 
        material respects in conformity with the functional specifications described in the 
        Documentation.
    b.  Licensor is not responsible for any claimed breach of any warranty caused by: 
        i.  modifications made to the Licensor Software by anyone other than Licensor;
        ii. the combination, operation or use of the Licensor Software with any items that are 
            not permitted in the Documentation;
        iii. Customer's failure to use any new or corrected versions of the Licensor Software 
            made available by Licensor;
        iv. Licensor's adherence to Customer's specifications or instructions;
        v.  Customer deviating from the Licensor Software operating procedures described in 
            the Documentation; or
        vi. Errors caused by customizations. Consulting services to correct defects or issues 
            subject to one of the above warranty exclusions may be procured by Licensee 
            under a Work Order pursuant to Licensor's standard time and material charges.
    c.  If the Licensor Software does not perform as warranted during the Warranty Period, 
        Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct Errors. Customer shall 
        promptly notify Licensor in writing of its claim within the Software Warranty Period. 
        Provided that such claim is determined by Licensor to be Licensor's responsibility, as 
        Customer's exclusive remedy for any warranty claim, Licensor shall, within 30 days of its 
        receipt of Customer's written notice, (i) correct such Error; (ii) provide Customer with a 
        plan reasonably acceptable to Customer for correcting the Error, or (iii) if neither (i) nor 
        (ii) can be accomplished with reasonable commercial efforts from Licensor, then Licensor 
        may terminate the affected Licensor Software license and issue Customer a refund of the 
        license fees paid for the affected Licensor Software. The preceding warranty cure 
        constitutes Licensor's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedy for Licensor's 
        breach of the warranty stated herein.
    d.  EXCEPT AS STATED ABOVE, LICENSOR, ITS LICENSORS, WEBHOST, 
        DATACENTER AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, TO THE MAXIMUM 
        EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
        ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING (i) ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY SOFTWARE, 
        MATERIALS OR SERVICES ARE ERROR-FREE, ACCURATE OR RELIABLE OR WILL 
        OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE 
        CORRECTED OR WILL COMPLY WITH ANY LAW, RULE OR REGULATION (ii) ANY 
        AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND (iii) ANY AND ALL 
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE 
        OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE. LICENSOR CANNOT AND DOES NOT 
        GUARANTEE THE PRIVACY, SECURITY OR AUTHENTICITY OF ANY INFORMATION 
        SO TRANSMITTED OVER OR STORED IN ANY SYSTEM CONNECTED TO THE 
        INTERNET.

9.  Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR (I) INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE 
    OTHER PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING TRADE SECRETS; (II) 
    DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY, DEATH, DAMAGE TO REAL OR TANGIBLE PERSONAL 
    PROPERTY; (III) INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE; OR (IV) ANY 
    OTHER LIABILITY THAT MAY NOT BE LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW (THE 
    "EXCLUDED MATTERS"), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS 
    OR UNAVAILABILITY OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA, LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, 
    FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, BUSINESS 
    INTERRUPTION, DOWNTIME COSTS OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
    CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR ANY SIMILAR TYPE OF 
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT, THE USE 
    OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, MAINTENANCE OR CONSULTING 
    SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. CUSTOMER 
    ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE AND 
    OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER TO ACHIEVE CUSTOMER'S 
    INTENDED RESULTS. EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUDED MATTERS, IN NO EVENT SHALL 
    EITHER PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF 
    OR AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF 1,000,000 USD OR 
    THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO LICENSOR UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER 
    FORM.

10. Export. Software, Documentation, Materials, and related technical data are subject to U.S. 
    export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated regulations 
    and may be subject to export or import regulations of other countries. Customer shall not 
    export or re-export or provide access to the Software, Documentation, and Materials in any 
    form in violation of any applicable export or import laws of any jurisdiction.

11. Government Use. If the Software, Documentation, Materials and any other Licensor services 
    are being or have been acquired with U.S. Federal Government funds, or Customer is an 
    agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government ("Government"), the use, 
    duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software or any 
    related documentation of any kind, including technical data, manuals or Materials, is restricted 
    in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian agencies and Defense 
    Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military agencies. The Software, 
    Materials, and any Licensor services are COMMERCIAL ITEMS AS DEFINED BY THE 
    FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION. Use of the Software and Materials by the 
    Government is further restricted according to the Agreement and any amendment hereto.

12. Term and Termination. 
    a.  Except as otherwise stated below, this Agreement will remain in effect until terminated.
    b.  The Term for any Software starts on the Effective Date stated in an Order Form and 
        continues as indicated on the Order Form.
    c.  Following the end of the initial Term for any Subscription, Term License, or Cloud 
        Service, the Term will automatically renew continuously for the same length as the initial 
        Term unless either party gives written notice at least 60 days prior to the end of the initial 
        or any renewal Term of its intention to terminate.
    d.  Either party may terminate: 
        i.  this Agreement and/or any applicable Order Forms upon 30 days prior written 
            notice if the other party breaches a material provision of this Agreement and fails to 
            cure such breach within the 30 day notice period;
        ii. Maintenance, Term License, or Subscription, upon written notice delivered at least 
            60 days prior to the end of any applicable annual Maintenance period or Term; or
        iii. an Order Form for Consulting Services, upon 15 days prior written notice by 
            Customer or 30 days prior written notice by Licensor.
    e.  The Agreement automatically terminates if either party files for bankruptcy, goes into 
        receivership, becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
    f.  Upon termination of this Agreement or an Order Form, Customer must cease using, de-
        install and permanently delete all of the applicable Software, whether modified or merged 
        into other materials.
    g.  Termination of this Agreement or any Order Form does not (i) relieve Customer of its 
        obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by Customer under 
        this Agreement or (ii) limit either party from pursuing other remedies available to it, 
        including injunctive relief.
    h.  The parties' rights and obligations under this section and sections entitled "Financial 
        Terms", "Ownership", "Confidentiality", "Warranties", "Indemnity", "Remedies", "Limitation 
        of Liability", "General Provisions" and those surviving provisions of the Exhibits survive 
        the termination of this Agreement and/or an Order Form.

13. General Provisions. 
    a.  All notices must be in writing and will be effective if (i) delivered by facsimile, electronic 
        mail, by hand, reliable overnight delivery service, or first-class, pre-paid mail and (ii) sent 
        to the address for the intended recipient stated in an Order Form. Notices should be sent 
        to the other party's general counsel or legal department, unless another recipient is 
        expressly identified.
    b.  The non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, 
        incurred by the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the prevailing party's 
        rights under this Agreement.
    c.  This Agreement does not create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither 
        party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other.
    d.  During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one year following termination of 
        an Order Form, neither party shall actively solicit for employment any employee, 
        contractor, consultant, or other representative of the other party who performed services 
        in connection with the applicable Order Form, without the prior written consent of the 
        other party.
    e.  Licensor may designate any agent or subcontractor to perform such tasks and functions 
        to complete any services covered under this Agreement, provided, however, that 
        Licensor shall remain responsible for performance of its duties under the terms of this 
        Agreement.
    f.  During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one year following termination of 
        an Order Form, Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, may audit 
        Customer's compliance with this Agreement upon 10 days' notice and at reasonable 
        times and report any results to Licensor's licensors. Customer shall, at no cost to 
        Licensor, (i) provide any assistance reasonably requested by Licensor or its designee in 
        conducting any such audit, including installing and operating audit software, (ii) make 
        requested personnel, records, and information available to Licensor or its designee, and 
        (iii) provide such assistance, personnel, records, systems access, and information to 
        facilitate the timely completion of such audit. Customer's failure to comply with the 
        provisions of this section will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If the audit 
        reveals any noncompliance, Customer shall reimburse Licensor for the reasonable costs 
        and expenses of the audit (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees), and 
        Customer shall promptly cure any such noncompliance; provided, however, that the 
        obligations under this section do not constitute a waiver of Licensor's termination rights 
        and do not affect Licensor's right to payment for Software or Materials related to usage in 
        excess of the Number of Units.
    g.  A waiver by a party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will not be 
        construed as waiver of continuing or succeeding breach.
    h.  Performance under the Agreement will be postponed automatically if a party is prevented 
        from performing by any act of or failure to act by the other party. No delay or default in 
        performance of any obligation by either party (except payment obligations) will constitute 
        a breach of the Agreement if caused by force majeure or any other cause which is 
        beyond its reasonable control, including, fires, strikes, accidents, or acts of God.
        i.  Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to an Affiliate, neither party may 
            assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, and/or any of its rights and/or obligations 
            without the prior written consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably 
            withheld. Any such attempted assignment is void. For the purposes of the foregoing, a 
            change in control of Customer is deemed to cause or attempt to cause an assignment of 
            the Agreement, in whole or part, and requires Licensor's prior written consent.
    j.  If Customer or its successors or assigns enters into an Extraordinary Corporate Event 
        after an Order Form Effective Date, those users, divisions, or entities that were added to 
        or divested from Customer's organization as a result of the Extraordinary Corporate 
        Event are not authorized to use the Software or Materials until those users, divisions, or 
        entities are added to this Agreement by way of a written amendment signed by duly 
        authorized officers of the Licensor and Customer, or in the case of a divesture, the 
        divested entity.
    k.  This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted 
        assigns, and does not confer any rights or benefits on any third party, including any 
        employee of a party, any client of a party, or any employee of a client of a party. 
        Notwithstanding the above, the parties acknowledge that all rights and benefits afforded 
        to Licensor under this Agreement apply equally to the owner of any Third Party Software, 
        and such third party is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.
    l.  If Customer is entering into the Agreement from a European Union member country, 
        Norway, Switzerland, Japan, India or Australia, then the Agreement is governed by the 
        laws of Ireland and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. 
        Otherwise, the Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and subject 
        to the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Court for the Northern District Court of California, 
        without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on 
        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information 
        Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.
    m.  If any sentence, clause, or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, 
        or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of 
        liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions 
        are not affected or impaired. The parties shall interpret the affected provision in a manner 
        that renders it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the 
        economic effect of the affected provision.
    n.  If any terms and conditions of the Master Terms conflict with the Documentation, then 
        such license requirements or notices pertaining to Third Party Software included with the 
        Software will control. Any conflict between the terms of the Agreement will be resolved in 
        the following order for precedence: (i) Order Form; (ii) Exhibits, (iii) Master Terms.
    o.  The Agreement constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It 
        supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communication between the parties relating to 
        its subject matter. No modification to the Agreement will be binding unless in writing and 
        signed by each party, except in the case of an Order Form where Licensor's acceptance 
        shall be deemed to have occurred on Licensor's initial delivery of products or services 
        under the Order Form. All pre-printed or standard terms of any Customer purchase order 
        or other business processing document shall have no effect.

14. Alpha, Beta, Developer Evaluation, Free Trial and Evaluation License. 
    a.  In addition to all other applicable terms and conditions, Software provided or accessed 
        for demonstration or evaluation purposes or for alpha or beta testing is subject to the 
        following conditions: 
        i.  Software may only be used for demonstration, evaluation or alpha or beta testing 
            purposes,
        ii. Customer must stop using the Software upon the earlier of (1) 30 days from the 
            date Customer receives the right to install or access the Software, (2) Customer's 
            receipt of notice of termination from Licensor, or (3) Customer no longer has 
            access to the Software; and
        iii. the Software is provided "AS IS" without Maintenance or any warranties or 
            indemnities.
    b.  In addition to all other applicable terms and conditions, Software provided or accessed 
        for Developer evaluation is subject to the following conditions: 
        i.  Software may only be used for such development evaluation purposes,
        ii. Software must not used or deployed in or on a Production or development 
            environment,
        iii. Customer must stop using the Software upon the earlier of (1) 90 days from the 
            date Customer receives the right to install or access the Software, (2) Customer`s 
            receipt of notice of termination from Customer, or (3) Customer no longer has 
            access to Cloud Service; and
        iv. the Software is provided "AS IS" without Maintenance or any warranties or 
            indemnities.
    c.  If Customer is using a free trial version of Software, Licensor may stop providing the 
        Software to Customer or Customer's end users at Licensor's sole discretion without any 
        prior notice, and the Software is provided "AS IS" without Maintenance or any warranties 
        or indemnities.
    d.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Software subject to an alpha, 
        beta, developer, evaluation, free trial and evaluation license may be deployed by 
        Customer on AWS, Microsoft Azure, or similar environments.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION 
         
           1. Definitions.

              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document. 
         
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by 
              the copyright owner that is granting the License. 
         
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all 
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common 
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, 
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or 
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 
         
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity 
              exercising permissions granted by this License. 
         
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, 
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation 
              source, and configuration files. 
         
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but 
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below). 
         
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 
         
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including 
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner 
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, 
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." 
         
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
              subsequently incorporated within the Work. 
         
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 
         
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
              as of the date such litigation is filed. 
         
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
              meet the following conditions: 
         
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 
         
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
                  stating that You changed the files; and 
         
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
                  the Derivative Works; and 
         
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
                  as modifying the License. 
         
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
              the conditions stated in this License. 
         
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 
         
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 
         
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, 
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 
         
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
         
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. 
         
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
         
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
