Product Name	 : TIBCO(R) Graph Database - Community Edition
Release Version	 : 2.0.0
Release Date	 : November 2018

======================================================================
Introduction 

TIBCO Graph Database allows users to leverage the “Power of
Relationships” to solve connectivity and reachability
problems at scale.

To unveil the true value of constantly evolving business data,
it is critical to connect and understand the relationships
between data in a much more meaningful way. Unlike other
databases, TIBCO Graph Database puts relationships at the
forefront and utilizes Graph theory and Linear Algebra to
traverse and more thoroughly understand complex webs of data.
It allows users to discover, store and convert complex dynamic
data into meaningful and understandable insights for the
business.

TIBCO Graph Database can be effectively leveraged for various
use-cases including:

Graph Traversals and Aggregation:
Various use-cases in logistics, manufacturing, supply-chain,
pharmaceuticals, and resource management require complex
traversal and aggregation of datasets in near real time.
Traditional relational databases cannot handle these types of
queries, given the growing volumes and complexity. The TIBCO(R)
Graph Database can be effectively leveraged to execute complex
graph traversals and computations on modern CPU(s) to deliver
linear performance at scale.

Root Cause and Impact Analysis:
Empower users to quickly identify the root cause behind
business opportunities or threats by executing advanced
analytical algorithms on knowledge graphs leveraging modern
GPU-based hardware architectures.

Artificial Intelligence Data Store:
AI knowledge is represented as a dense temporal network data
set. The TIBCO(R) Graph Database enables users to utilize AI
algorithms and models to effectively and efficiently ask the
right set of questions of their data to discover additional
insights.

IoT Applications:
Create digital twin representations or device virtual
identities by efficiently representing and managing multiple
profiles. Scale to support millions of IoT devices and their
attributes (programmable and non-programmable) as knowledge
graphs.
