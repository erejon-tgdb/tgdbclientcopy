# The syscipher is used for creating a System-Wide Self Signed Database certificate.

# The cipher name is a TLS 1.2 Cipher Name obtained from IANA Registry.
# See https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4
# It can be obtained by running
# $> openssl -V ciphers
